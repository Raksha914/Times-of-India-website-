                India all-rounder Washington Sundar clinched the India cricket team's behind-the-scenes 'Impact Fielder' Award for the just-concluded T20I series against Bangladesh. He edged out Hardik Pandya and Riyan Parag, with India's fielding coach T Dilip hailing Washington's outstanding improvement and noting that he appeared as a "different" player in terms of his fielding. Riding on Sanju Samson's belligerent century, India notched up a record 297 total, clinching a dominant 133-run victory over Bangladesh here to win the T20I series 3-0 and complete a 5-0 sweep of the Test and T20I series.

Dilip's contender No. 1 was Pandya as the fielding coach compared his energy on the field to "a Formula 1 car in top gear." Parag was the contender No. 2 for "making catches look simple".

On Parag, the coach remarked: "When it comes to cutting angles and saving runs, he makes catches look so simple. I love the way he feels bad when he misses those one-percent chances on the field. Riyan Parag, contender number two. Hats off to the composure with which he takes those catches." But Washington pipped the duo for his "precision at the boundary line." Washington took three catches in the series and returned with a brilliant economy rate of just five runs per over.

"He's been exceptional when it comes to anticipation and cutting angles in the field. Every time you come here; you try to improve. I've seen a different Washington Sundar this time around," he said. Giving his speech standing beside head coach Gautam Gambhir, Dilip also hailed the collective spirit of the team.
