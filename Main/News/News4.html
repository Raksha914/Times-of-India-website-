              <h2>India on the brink after nailbiting final-over defeat to Australia</h2>
              <img src="https://images.icc-cricket.com/image/upload/t_ratio21_9-size60/v1728871246/prd/x6kzs9x4pz9jwtu8tbm3" alt="">

                Harmanpreet Kaur’s superb 54* saw India go agonisingly close to a tournament-saving win over defending champions Australia, with Kaur’s side sliding to a nine-run defeat and leave them needing a big helping hand from neighbours Pakistan to qualify for the semi-finals.

Kaur had rebuilt for India as they looked to chase down 152 to win, and accelerated to her half-century to set up a final over where 14 runs were required.

But four wickets fell in Annabel Sutherland’s final over, including two run outs, as India and Kaur fell short of the winning post.

              <p>Earlier, Renuka Singh (2/24) and Deepti Sharma (2/28) starred in a strong bowling showing from India, but the depth of Australia’s batting talent nevertheless steered them to an impressive 151/8 from their 20 overs.

                Grace Harris, coming into the team in place of the injured captain Alyssa Healy, top-scored with 40 (41 balls), while there were valuable contributions throughout the middle and lower order, with stand-in skipper Tahlia McGrath (32) and Ellyse Perry (32) the biggest contributors.
                
                The result means that India can only finish in the top two in Group A if Pakistan beat New Zealand on Monday by a narrow-enough margin not to move into second themselves on NRR. A win for the White Ferns in that game will consign India to a group-stage exit.
                
                Australia are the first team to seal a place in the semi-finals, having won all four of their group matches.

              <p>And fellow opener Smriti Mandhana also fell in the powerplay, trapped lbw by Sophie Molineux to end a patient contribution of 6 (12).

                India closed the powerplay with the score on 41/2, with Jemimah Rodrigues and captain Harmanpreet Kaur out in the middle.
                
                But Rodrigues soon joined the openers back in the dugout, caught for 16 (12), and India needed a big second half of the innings with the score at 67/3 at drinks."</p>
