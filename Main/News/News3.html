                'Will not be left unpunished ...,' Eknath Shinde reiterates Maharashtra govt commitment to public safety after Baba Siddique murder
              
              Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde addressed the state's law and order situation following the killing of NCP leader Baba Siddique, stating that the government is committed to ensuring public safety and will ensure that the accused responsible for such crimes will be held accountable and will not be left unpunished.
              
              Shinde confirmed that Mumbai police have arrested two individuals in connection with the case and reiterated that the safety of Maharashtra's citizens is a top priority for the government.
              
              Speaking to ANI, Shinde said on Sunday, "Yesterday's incident of Baba Siddique's murder is unfortunate and sad. Mumbai Police has arrested two people, one is from UP and the other from Haryana. The third accused is absconding. He will be arrested soon. They will not be spared no matter who they are be it the Bishnoi gang or any underworld gang. Strict action will be taken. Those who are receiving threats, their safety is the state government's responsibility and it will fulfil its responsibility."
              Baba Siddique earned praise during pandemic, was friends with Bollywood stars
              
              Baba Siddique, a former minister in Maharashtra, was tragically shot and killed in Mumbai. The 66-year-old leader was well-known in Bollywood circles and had gained recognition for his efforts in providing essential medicines to those in need during the Covid pandemic. At the height of the crisis, he worked tirelessly to secure highly sought-after medications for patients who required them urgently.
              
              Siddique was also famous for hosting lavish Iftar parties, which were attended by prominent Bollywood celebrities. He had a strong presence in Maharashtra politics, having represented the Bandra (West) constituency in the state assembly for three terms. As a prominent Muslim leader in Mumbai, he maintained close relationships with several Bollywood stars, including Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Sanjay Dutt.
              
              Zeeshan Siddique, Baba Siddique's son, currently serves as a Congress MLA from Mumbai, carrying forward his father's legacy in the political arena.

              <p>'Baba Siddique's murder 100 per cent failure of govt, law and order,' says Congress MP Imran Masood
              
                Congress MP Imran Masood said on Sunday that the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique is "100 per cent a failure of Maharashtra government and law and order."
                
                The MP further mentioned that the NCP leader had received death threats earlier.
                
                "This is a sad incident; the death of a politician or anyone else is tragic. He was a famous person in Mumbai and worked for the people," Masood told ANI.
                
                Speaking on the recent arrests made by Mumbai police in the case, he said, "He had received security earlier because he had gotten death threats. Someone first says that they will kill you, and then they kill you, so that is totally the government's failure--100 per cent a failure."</p>
