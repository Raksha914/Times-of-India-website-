                NEW DELHI: The mothers of the two accused in the murder of Nationalist Congress Party leader Baba Siddique on Sunday said that they were not aware of their sons' intentions and had minimal contact with them.

                "He went to Pune to work in a scrapyard. I knew only this.. I was not aware of what he was doing in Mumbai. He had come home in Holi, and after that he did not come. He was not even taking to me on calls so I cannot say anything about the incident. He is around 18 to 19 years. He had just sent Rs 3,000 to me when my daughter was sick," she told ANI.

Meanwhile, mother of Uttar Pradesh native Dharamraj Kashyap said that her 19-year-old was also working at a scrapyard in Pune. However, Kashyap had only contacted her mother once.

"Two months ago, he had gone to work in a scrapyard in Pune. He has contacted me only once since he had left. The police had come and they had informed me about him," she said.

              Baba Siddique murder case: Ossification test confirms accused Dharmaraj Kashyap is not minor; sent to police custody
              
              The Mumbai police have confirmed that Dharmaraj Kashyap, who is accused of murdering former Maharashtra Minister and NCP leader Baba Siddique, is not a minor based on the results of an ossification test. The test, which assesses a person's age by examining the extent of bone fusion, is a standard method for determining age.
              
              After the test results were obtained, Kashyap was brought before the court, which remanded him to police custody until October 21.
              
              The ossification test was ordered by Mumbai's Esplanade Court in response to a claim made by Kashyap's lawyer that he was a minor.

              <p>'Baba Siddique's murder 100 per cent failure of govt, law and order,' says Congress MP Imran Masood
              
                Congress MP Imran Masood said on Sunday that the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique is "100 per cent a failure of Maharashtra government and law and order."
                
                The MP further mentioned that the NCP leader had received death threats earlier.
                
                "This is a sad incident; the death of a politician or anyone else is tragic. He was a famous person in Mumbai and worked for the people," Masood told ANI.
                
                Speaking on the recent arrests made by Mumbai police in the case, he said, "He had received security earlier because he had gotten death threats. Someone first says that they will kill you, and then they kill you, so that is totally the government's failure--100 per cent a failure."</p>
